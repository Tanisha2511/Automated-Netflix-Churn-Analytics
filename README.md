# Automated Netflix Churn Analytics

## Project Overview
This project analyzes customer churn behavior for a Netflix-like subscription platform using SQL and Power BI.  
The goal is to identify churn drivers and generate actionable insights to improve customer retention and subscription strategies.

SQL is used for data cleaning, transformation, and advanced analysis. The cleaned dataset is then used in Power BI to build an automated, interactive churn analytics dashboard.
